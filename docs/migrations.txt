To update the format of a recipe in the db, go to:

https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/60ac3027b145744fd08a66b1#clusters

And navigate through "browse collections" -> your collection -> "aggregation",
then choose your operations, including $set and $out.

Note: If you use the $out aggregation stage to modify a collection with an Atlas Search index,
you must delete and re-create the search index. If possible, consider using $merge instead of $out.

To create a backup, grab the json response from https://choch-buech.ch/all.

Example:

$set
{
  archived: false
}

$merge
{
  into: 'recipes',
  on: '_id',
  whenMatched: 'replace',
  whenNotMatched: 'fail'
}
